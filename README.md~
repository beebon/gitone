some common shell on ubuntu one,just for convinience to my work.it's even not a really project.

Usage:

   $ . i.sh #init .bashrc for use all .sh as a comman in the direction
   $ . ~/.bashrc #for making the .bashrc config updating enabled immediatly
   $ u conf //test wether the command goes work,if the bashrc open with vim,it work!
